Code for setting up cohort diagnostics in AWS
============

Currently ROhdsiWebApi doesnÂ´t support AWS (as of 01/12/2020 - there are a couple of braches which suggests this might be in the process of getting fixed). In the meantime this is the code to set up a cohort diagnostics package with cohorts created in ATLAS. 

To use, get the example package out of the cohort diagnostics github, zip, and upload to AWS. Go inside the RProj (make sure you have required dependencies installed etc first), and then run this code where you specify the cohort ids from ATLAS etc.
